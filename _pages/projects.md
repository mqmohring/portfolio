## Global Layoffs Analysis (2022-2025)  

The past few years have seen significant workforce reductions across industries, driven by economic uncertainty, technological shifts, and post-pandemic adjustments. This project explores global layoff trends from 2022 to 2025, analyzing between others:  

- **Most affected regions, companies, and industries**  
- **Timing of peak layoffs**  
- **Relationship between funding and workforce reductions**  

### Methodology  
- Cleaned and processed the dataset using **SQL** (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- Visualized trends and insights using **Python** (Matplotlib/Seaborn)  
- Explored key questions like:  
  - Which sectors were hit hardest?  
  - Did well-funded companies lay off more or fewer employees?  
  - Were there regional differences in layoff patterns?  

### Key Findings  
ðŸ”¹ **Consumer and retail** saw the highest layoffs  
ðŸ”¹ Layoffs peaked in **early 2023**  
ðŸ”¹ Companies with **lower funding rounds** were more likely to downsize

## 3. Global Layoffs 3: Python Visualisation
2023 was the year with highest layout indexes, peaking in the first quarter:

The most affected industries were Consumer, Retail and Hardware:

Denmark, Vietnam and Nigeria show the highest layoff indexes:

Is there a correlation between company size and layoff indexes?

While higher-funded companies lay off more people in total, this is largely due to their size. It seems necessary to cross-reference with layoff percentages:

Lower funding does seem to reflect on higher exposure to layoffs. A regression plot shows this clearly too:

- Positive correlation in advanced stages like Series J, suggest that some companies raised significant funding but still had high layoff percentages.  
- This could reflect overexpansion or overhiring followed by corrections, strategic misalignment (money was raised, but business goals weren't met), or investor pressure to cut costs post-funding round.  
- This could point to overfunded companies in decline, poor capital efficiency or late-stage companies with bloated ops trimming aggressively. 

### Conclusions
ðŸ”¹ According to these graphs, companies with **lower funding rounds were more likely to downsize proportionally**.  
ðŸ”¹ Early-stage companies experience higher relative downsizing, meaning they are more likely to lay off a larger share of their staff, and in some cases, nearly all of it.  
ðŸ”¹ This aligns with the common startup risk curve â€” early-stage companies face more volatility, resource constraints, and abrupt strategy pivots that lead to higher relative layoffs.
